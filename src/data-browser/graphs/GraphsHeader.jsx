    <h1>HMDA Graphs</h1>
    <p>
      The following graphs present data for the 19 financial institutions
      reporting HMDA quarterly data throughout 2020 and displays data for each
      of those institutions for 2019 and 2018 as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the graphs provide some insight into trends for these institutions,
      they should not be taken to represent the behavior of all mortgage lenders
      during the relevant period.
